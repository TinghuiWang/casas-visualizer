# CASAS Smart Home Visualizer

The CASAS smart home visualizer is a visualization tool developed to help visualize the sensor events and resident activities in smart homes equipped with ambient sensors, such as motion sensors, magnetic door sensors or contact-based item sensors.
In addition to showing sensor events and status, the visualizer also plots the past trajectories of each resident in the smart home if annotated.
The tool is part of the research of WSU CASAS group on resident tracking and activities of daily activity (ADLs) recognition in multi-resident smart homes.
